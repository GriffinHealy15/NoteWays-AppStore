    func resized(withBounds bounds: CGSize, aspectFit: Bool) -> UIImage {
        // these four lines below calculate how big the new image should be in order to fit inside the bounds rectangle
        // bounds.width = width passed using CGSize
        
        // to find newSize, we say. What is size we want = 52, what is size of current image = 1125.
        // now lets find the ratio of them 52/1125 = 0.0462. Then we take image size = 1125 * 0.0462  = 52. That is the width of the image. Repeat for height. Then we draw image of size 52x52 pixels.
        let horizontalRatio = bounds.width / size.width

        let ratio = aspectFit ?
            // for min(aspect fit): if the horizontal ratio is smaller than vertical ratio, then we scale to horizontal, so vertical will be smaller (leaving top and bottom white space)
            // for max(aspect fill): if vertical ratio is bigger, we scale to vertical
            min(horizontalRatio, verticalRatio) : max(horizontalRatio, verticalRatio)
        // size.width * ratio (i.e. 1125 * 0.046) creates a smaller image size
